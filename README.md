# mini-message-board

This is a project for the [Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/home) curriculum. The assignment can be found [here](https://www.theodinproject.com/courses/nodejs/lessons/mini-message-board).\
This project uses nodejs for a very basic message board, without any database (it has no persistance of data).
